Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease: Comparative Analysis of Vocal Features

Project Overview

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder necessitating early detection
for optimised patient care. This thesis presents a comparative analysis of premotor indicators to
identify potential early signs of PD. Examined indicators include Rapid Eye Movement abnormalities, olfactory loss, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and dopaminergic imaging markers but we will
consider vocal frequencies as an indicator for now because studies show that non motor symptoms
such as speech and vocal indicators of a person can provide better accuracy in PD detection. The
study evaluates their efficacy in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals, considering
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Findings contribute
to understanding the premotor stage of PD and its potential as a diagnostic window for early detection. Incorporating premotor indicators into clinical practice can enhance disease management
and patient outcomes. This research aids healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals
and initiating timely interventions. By facilitating early diagnosis and intervention, it improves
the quality of life for individuals affected by PD and informs targeted treatment strategies. Overall, the study enhances knowledge on early PD detection, paving the way for improved care and
tailored interventions.
